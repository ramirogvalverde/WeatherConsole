Execute a cmd in the folder with the following command:


java -jar WeatherConsole-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar help


It will show the available options.


extra:


If the city name is longer than one word, use the underscore to join them. (ex. cabez√≥n_de_la_sal)


i'm aware of some of the limitations. it's not commented, not as clean as it should be... not tested, there is no log, and many others... no excuse for that. Time?


Thanks
